This game is notable for being the very first game that QB Ben Roethlisberger would miss out on against the Patriots. In the first quarter, The Patriots scored first when Tom Brady found James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, they increased their lead when LaGarrette Blount ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 14-0. The Steelers got on the board later on in the quarter when Landry Jones found Darrius Heyward-Bey on a 14-yard touchdown pass for a 14-7 game. The Steelers closed out the scoring of the first half when Chris Boswell kicked a 32-yard field goal for a 14-10 game at halftime. In the third quarter, the Steelers went back to work as Boswell kicked another field goal to get his team within 1, 14-13 from 46 yards out. The Pats pulled away later on when Brady found Rob Gronkowski on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) for a 20-13 game. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers came within 4 again when Boswell made a 44-yard field goal for a 20-16 game. But the Pats sealed the game after Blount ran for a 5-yard touchdown and the eventual final score of 27-16. With the loss, the Steelers went into their bye week at 4-3. Regardless, due to the Ravens' loss to the Jets, they still remain in first place in the AFC North. The team dropped to 0-1 on the season without Roethlisberger as a starter and their seven-game home winning streak was snapped."}, "history_2086": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day":

Behind them were the second battle, which consisted of 400 Italians and 1,000 men of Languedoc and central France. Charles commanded the second battle in person. Behind them, the third battle consisted of about 700 men from the county of Flanders under Constable of France Gilles II de Trasignies and Robert III of Flanders. Manfred had adopted similar dispositions. His Saracen archers were in the fore. Behind them was the first battle, 1,200 German mercenaries armed in coats of plates, commanded by his cousin Giordano d'Anglano and Galvano of Anglona. The second battle consisted of the Italian mercenaries, about 1,000, and 300 Saracen light horse, commanded by his uncle Galvano Lancia.

A decree of 13 September outlined new regulations. All heads of native households owed 500 r\u00e9is annually unless they were under contract  on agricultural plantations of more than 500 hectares or living in reinos producing at least 500,000 pounds of the valuable cash crops of coffee, cocoa or cotton. In those reinos where the capitation was collected, the liurai received half of all the revenues. The decree stipulated, furthermore, that all reinos with less than 600 heads of household were to be abolished, but this seems never to have been carried out. Liurais were forbidden to collect any tax or tribute but the capitation. With these measures, the Portuguese government sought to transform the reino into a fiscal unit and the liurai into a fiscal agent, while pushing independent cultivators into the more lucrative production of coffee . The head tax system was initially opposed by Manufahi and a few allies. In 1910, a commission was sent to take a census of the native population. It ascertained there were 98,920 heads of family eligible to pay tax in 73 or 75 loyal reinos. In disloyal reinos, such as Manufahi, which had seen fighting in 1907-08, the population had shrunk."}, "history_2014": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""},

for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record. The Bears would finish 3-13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined."}, "nfl_2894": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "29708a89-5223-4edd-be24-1128b7b7695b", "question": "this were field many game in How made goals?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}, "query_id": "fbc24a20-7568-47ec-9618-5fc9dd052f23", "question": "many in scored were How points total?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "636c2763-ba02-4db0-b2dd-a4abda571337", "question": "win Bears many points did the by How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Bears"]}, "query_id": "fca7116f-43b4-4fb3-95b9-350f39057dfa", "question": "or points, Bears scored chiefs Who more?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Bears"]}]}], "passage": " For the fifth game of the season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5-6 in the all-time series; the game was the first in Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31-3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton's 3-4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17-3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7:51 left in the game and down 17-6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18-17 win. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1,168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler. The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history."}, "nfl_1476": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "115",

Indianapolis would increase their lead in the second quarter with Stover's 37-yard field goal, yet the Texans closed out the half with kicker Kris Brown nailing a 56-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston began to gain ground as quarterback Matt Schaub completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Ryan Moats.  The Texans would take the lead in the fourth quarter as running back Steve Slaton got a 1-yard touchdown run, but the Colts retook the lead with running back Joseph Addai getting a 2-yard touchdown run.  Houston had a chance to tie the game with one second left in regulation, but Brown's 42-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.

Lions, the Raiders flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for an AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Broncos QB Jay Cutler completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Raiders got on the board with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 38-yard field goal.  However, Denver continued to pound away as RB Cecil Sapp got a 4-yard TD run, while kicker Jason Elam got a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland began to come back as QB Josh McCown (who was a gametime decision heading into the game) completed a 46-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders took the lead as DT Gerard Warren sacked Cutler in the end zone for a safety, while LB Thomas Howard returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown (followed by a successful two-point conversion pass from McCown to WR Ronald Curry).  However, the Broncos tied the game up with Elam's 20-yard field goal.  In overtime, Oakland managed to make Denver go three-and-out on their first possession.  A 33-yard run by RB LaMont Jordan helped set up Janikowski for a game-winning 52-yard field goal. Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called timeout before the kick could begin.  Janikowski's second try hit off the very tip of the left goal post and was no good, giving Denver a chance to win the game.  The Broncos won with Elam getting a 23-yard field goal. With the loss, not only did the Raiders fall to 0-2, but they had lost 11-straight games (currently the NFL's longest losing streak) dating back to Week 9 of the 2006 season."}, "nfl_2114":

They trailed again with kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 27-yard field goal, but took the lead after Rivers got an 11-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. They fell behind again in the second quarter as Foster made a 2-yard TD run, followed by Rackers hitting a 21 and a 25-yard field goal. The Chargers eventually pulled themselves in front again, with Rivers finding McMichael again on a 12-yard TD pass.

Eventually, both political factions supported an independent Finland, despite strong disagreement over the composition of the nation's leadership. Nationalism had become a \"civic religion\" in Finland by the end of nineteenth century, but the goal during the general strike of 1905 was a return to the autonomy of 1809-1898, not full independence. In comparison to the unitary Swedish regime, the domestic power of Finns had increased under the less uniform Russian rule. Economically, the Grand Duchy of Finland benefited from having an independent domestic state budget, a central bank with national currency, the markka , and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860-1916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and separation would disrupt the profitable Finnish financial zone.

to Ford Field to take on the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving football. Due to Matt Flynn's performance the previous week, he replaces Scott Tolzien and makes his first start for the Packers in the 2013 season. The Lions' opening possession ended at the Green Bay 12 when Clay Matthews forced a Reggie Bush fumble that was recovered by Morgan Burnett. However, the Packers could not capitalize, and the Lions drew first blood with a 27-yard field goal. Following a kickoff that went out-of-bounds, the Packers answered with a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 3-3. The Packers quickly struck again when Nick Perry forced a Matthew Stafford fumble that was returned by Morgan Burnett for a TD for a 10-3 lead. The Lions answered by scoring two TDs, first a 5-yard TD pass to Jeremy Ross, then a 1-yard run by Reggie Bush. Detroit had opportunities for more points before the half, but David Akers missed a 31-yard field goal as the 1st half expired, keeping a 17-10 lead. Following a 3-and-out on Green Bay's opening possession in the 3rd quarter, the Lions scored on a 20-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson, extending their lead 24-10. Late in the 3rd quarter, Ndamukong Suh sacked Matt Flynn in the endzone, forcing a safety that made it 26-10. The Lions capitalized on their next possession with a 1-yard run by Joique Bell. They followed that up with a 20-yard TD pass to Kevin Ogletree, which extended their lead 40-10. The Packers tried to rally with a 56-yard pass to James Jones, but Matt Flynn fumbled the snap on the next play, and Detroit recovered and ran out the clock.

Fielding suggested that it probably had about 21,000 members in early 1975, of whom 6,000 to 8,000 were \"paper members\" who had not renewed their membership subscriptions but not officially terminated their membership. Searchlight claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984, and to 1,000 in January 1985.

In the second quarter, the 'Hawks continued to trail as Cardinals QB Matt Leinart threw a 30-yard TD pass to TE Leonard Pope, along with RB Edgerrin James getting a 17-yard TD run.  Down 17-0, the Seahawks would respond just before halftime with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson. Arizona quickly moved into field goal range after the Seahawk TD, but Rackers hit the upright from 53 yards as time expired. In the third quarter, Seattle would come all the way back to tie the game after RB Shaun Alexander finally broke loose for a 16-yard TD run and kicker Josh Brown booted a 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks took the lead with Brown kicking another 28-yard field goal.  However, Arizona rallied to tie the game on a Rackers 52-yard field goal.  The Seahawks appeared to be driving for the go ahead score when, inside field goal range in the final 2 minutes, an exchange from Hasselbeck to Alexander was fumbled and recovered by the Cardinals. Arizona then drove to the Seahawks' 25-yard line, where Rackers kicked a game-winning 42-yard field goal with 11 seconds left.

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing \"bad medicine\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years. The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor. Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces."}, "nfl_3126": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "a1b87dd0-c456-4d20-b1e1-4e8e7cff89eb", "question": "have the How the losses did cowboys against many giants?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, "query_id": "2e287244-a22f-4e33-b1cb-fd6e81aa8d63", "question": "How dallas get yard penalty did many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "46e33ed4-85d1-4ae0-832e-88c2e6012467", "question": "Winston did turnover have Jameis How many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}, "query_id": "b09f3c95-c28a-473c-b120-df9faa59e9c0", "question": "dallas lead did how points by many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " Following their second loss to the Giants, the Cowboys returned to Arlington in a match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (who were coming off a five-game winning streak).

In accordance with the treaty, on 6 December 1922 the entire island of Ireland became a self-governing Dominion called the Irish Free State . Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Parliament of Northern Ireland had the option to leave the Irish Free State one month later and return to the United Kingdom. During the intervening period, the powers of the Parliament of the Irish Free State and Executive Council of the Irish Free State did not extend to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland exercised its right under the treaty to leave the new Dominion and rejoined the United Kingdom on 8 December 1922. It did so by making an address to the King requesting, \"that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.\" The Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy sharing a monarch with the United Kingdom and other Dominions of the British Commonwealth.

Previously, the Socialist Revolutionary Party had supported the continuation of the war by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. The Bolshevik Party came to power in November 1917 through the simultaneous election in the soviets and an organized uprising supported by military mutiny. Several of the main reasons the population supported the Bolsheviks were to end the war and have a social revolution, exemplified by the slogan \"Peace, Land, Bread\". The Bolsheviks invited left SRs and Martov's Menshevik Internationalists to join the government. Left SRs split from the main SR party and joined the Bolshevik coalition government, supporting the Bolsheviks immediate enactment of the Socialist Revolutionary Party's land redistribution program. The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the Cheka. The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war and were dismayed that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave up large amounts of territory. They left the Council of the People's Commissars in protest in March 1918. The Left SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution but opposed having the government legally pronouncing death sentences, an unusual position that is best understood within the context of the group's terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and opposed Trotsky's insistence that nobody was allowed to attack German troops in Ukraine. At the 5th All-Russia Congress of Soviets of July 4, 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total.

An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker.

After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end Brent Celek, the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb found wide receiver DeSean Jackson wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles up 10-7. On the ensuing drive by the Redskins, Campbell threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss to take the lead 14-10. Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14-13. The Redskins received the ball again and Campbell threw a second straight interception to Samuel, who returned it for 17 yards. The Eagles ended the first half with a second straight field goal to take the lead 16-14. The Eagles got the ball to start the second half, but the drive ended with a Sav Rocca punt. Jason Campbell threw a 10-yard touchdown to tight end Fred Davis to take the lead once again, 21-16. After two straight punts for each team, the Eagles got the ball back in the fourth quarter and Donovan McNabb threw an intended pass to Reggie Brown, but the pass was intercepted by Redskins cornerback Justin Tryon. The Redskins scored on a 25-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham, to increase their lead 24-16. The Eagles started their drive on their own 10-yard line after a penalty on the kick return by Dimitri Patterson. The Eagles went 90 yards to score on an Eldra Buckley one-yard touchdown run. Since they were losing by two points, the Eagles decided to go for a two-point conversion.

Van Coehoorn was a difficult character with few friends while William's death in March 1702 deprived him of his most powerful sponsor and much of his influence. The campaigns of 1702 and 1703 showed his limitations as a field officer and led to criticism from both Marlborough and Dutch colleagues.

It also marked the second consecutive year that the Raiders began the season on the road. On September 9, one day before the first game of the season, the Raiders placed Sebastian Janikowski on injured reserve due to an injured back. They signed Giorgio Tavecchio off the practice squad to do the kicking. The Raiders started well as the Titans tried to surprise the Raiders with an onside kick on the opening kickoff which the Raiders recovered. Four plays later, Derek Carr hit Amari Cooper who bowled into the endzone for an eight-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders the lead 7-0. The Titans answered on their ensuing drive, going 75 yards on 12 plays with Marcus Mariota rushing for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the game. The Raiders came back as Tavecchio hit his first career field goal, a 20-yarder, to give the Raiders a 10-7 lead. After exchanging punts in the early part of the second quarter, the Titans tied the game with 43 seconds remaining in the half on a Ryan Succop 23-yard field goal. The Raider offense moved 41 yards with time winding down to set up Tavecchio's second field goal, from 52 yards out, to give the Raiders the halftime lead 13-10. In the second half, the Raider defense held the Titans to punts on consecutive drives as the Raiders notched another 52-yard field goal to extend the lead to 16-10 with a little over four minutes left in the third period. The Raider defense prevented a Titans touchdown on the ensuing drive, forcing the Titans to settle for a 26-yard field goal which narrowed the gap to 16-13 as the period expired. In the fourth quarter, Carr led the Raiders on a seven play, 70-yard drive capped off by a Seth Roberts 19-yard touchdown reception. The Raiders defense, which had struggled immensely the previous year, forced the Titans to punt and then held them to a field goal with 4:49 remaining. Another Tavecchio field goal, this time from 43 yards out, extended the lead to 26-16 with 1:14 left in the game. The Titans could muster no more, missing a 52-yard field goal with 12 seconds remaining as the Raiders pulled out the win 26-16. In the win, Tavecchio became the first kicker in NFL history to make two 50-yard field goals in an NFL debut. Following his performance, Tavecchio was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Marshawn Lynch ran for 76 yards on 18 carries in his Raider debut.

the Irish Civil War was fought between Irish Nationalist factions meant that the sporadic conflict in Northern Ireland ended. Collins and Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end it on 30 March 1922, but, despite this, Collins covertly supplied arms to the Northern IRA until a week before his death in August 1922. Because of the Irish Civil War, Northern Ireland was able to consolidate its existence and the partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. The continuing war also confirmed the northern Unionists' existing prejudices against the ethos of all shades of nationalism. This might have led to open hostilities between North and South had the Irish Civil War not broken out. Indeed, the Ulster Special Constabulary  that had been established in 1920  was expanded in 1922 rather than being demobilised. In the event, it was only well after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland . The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army. The cost of the war and the budget deficit it caused was a difficulty for the new Free State and affected the Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925, which were to determine the border with Northern Ireland. The Free State agreed to waive its claim to predominantly Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland and in return its agreed share of the Imperial debt under the 1921 Treaty was not paid."}, "history_733": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "aed8ef30-af25-4472-881f-331714188f82", "question": "Army IRA until Irish Council by years the the the Provisional How many Republic Government the Treaty it of was annuled was Anglo-Irish?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}, "query_id": "81775409-93e5-444f-9368-045419f0acbc", "question": "How listed War veterans many are Civil?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "d6eb8c17-da01-4bf1-bfcb-98a87c8d7bb2", "question": "How listed Civil republican are War many veterans?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "82201af1-4bf9-4f75-9b69-76c39b8a4549", "question": "veterans War Civil State listed are Free many Supporter How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "824a7d43-260b-4bd0-800b-20cf3a1e32c6", "question": "wounds last civil generations many did of How the war the?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "30", "spans": []}, "query_id": "cb2926e4-d141-4224-9a11-bd13ef54d691", "question": "on legitimate declared attacks military Provisional be Government Irish the IRA the southern Army to forces years before the renounced many IRA Council of the of the state it How did the Irish Republic was claim ?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "30", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "As with most civil wars, the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy, which continues to influence Irish politics to this day. The two largest political parties in the republic through most of its history  were Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the Civil War, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Republicans \u00c9amon de Valera, Frank Aiken, Todd Andrews, and Se\u00e1n Lemass; and Free State supporters W. T. Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy and Kevin O'Higgins. Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna F\u00e1il took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the IRA and the pro-Free State Blueshirts. Fortunately, this crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland. However, the breakaway IRA continued  to exist. It was not until 1948 that the IRA renounced military attacks on the forces of the southern Irish state when it became the Republic of Ireland. After this point, the organisation dedicated itself primarily to the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA Army Council still makes claim to be the legitimate Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921."}, "history_2704": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, "query_id": "54c4b544-a9dd-4e48-af70-c66f1c09b18f", "question": "Brigade into after SS unit two the months regiments regiments into the split many amalgamated was Cavalry two How the were?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15878", "spans": []}, "query_id": "a6210b2f-7ba4-4883-a397-702c37562caf", "question": "total did state killed Fegeleins report many How final?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15878", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "15878", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9522", "spans": []}, "query_id": "0eec5fc7-a147-414d-9f36-e97bfdf1dfb0", "question": "Jews Henning were How more killed were many Pieper report reported in Fegeleins final than did estimate?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9522", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9522", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40", "spans": []}, "query_id": "d041e227-a0bc-4c38-8a48-8d3e02e11958", "question": "Fegelein as Florian commander regiments charge took SS after appointed Geyer the months 8th Cavalry many he of both Division was of How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13177", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c10c03b4-7f5d-4dca-b627-e006cc2e7cb7", "question": "according How were report final than partisans to more many Fegeleins killed Jews?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13177", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13177", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "302", "spans": []}, "query_id": "9379a6cb-6cea-4219-9d47-00e3108f40bc", "question": "soldiers than were Red according report final to many more How Fegeleins partisans Army killed?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "302", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "302", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13479", "spans": []}, "query_id": "8a612017-cdc6-41a3-bfd7-3a99dd3217a7", "question": "Army soldiers to according Red Fegeleins final report many were than Jews How killed more?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13479", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "13479", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "5e175dc7-70d5-4027-acc8-45f475f3bb13", "question": "Brigade Battle did report his of losses Fegelein suffer Moscow many serious the SS after issued in Cavalry final months the How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "29", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, "query_id": "e240629c-b5ef-498d-be08-d88b3c98a574", "question": "many How the regiments into being amalgamated SS unit split to Cavalry months was Brigade prior the into 2?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "The unit was split into two regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both.

The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July, twelve days after the operation started. Fegeleins final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the Battle of Moscow, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons. Fegelein was appointed as commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer on 20 April 1943. This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians.

In the third quarter, the Browns offense finally got going as Cleveland quarterback Charlie Frye hooked up with TE Kellen Winslow on an 18-yard touchdown pass.  Fortunately, the Saints would respond with a 12-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Drew Brees to WR Marques Colston.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns came close with Frye getting a 1-yard touchdown run.  However, the Saints put the game away with Carney kicking a 20-yard FG to give the Saints the win. Despite not scoring a touchdown, RB Reggie Bush had a sound NFL debut, as he ran 14 times for 61 yards, caught 8 passes for 58 yards, and returned three punts for 22 Yards.

Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time.

Laconia, with seat at Monemvasia , Messenia, with seat at Navarino, and Achaea, with seat at Patras . The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy. The Venetians also launched a great fortification project throughout the Morea, whose results can still be seen today. Nevertheless, Venice itself was too weakened to effectively assert its authority, and in 1715 a swift Ottoman campaign  reclaimed the Morea."}, "nfl_317": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year":

The relative quiet of the Tatar attacks on Russia in the late 30s and early 40s of the 17th century is undoubtedly due to the occupation of Azov by the Don Cossacks. The Russian government did not want to start a war with Turkey, did not send troops and after a long occupation the Cossacks left the town in 1642. The builders of the Belgorod Line and residents of the southern Russian districts, by the increase of Tatar attacks, immediately felt the change in the situation on the lower reaches of the Don. 3. In summer of 1633, 2000 Budjak Tatars invaded the southern Polish land and began to ravage Podolia. Crown Field Hetman Stanislaw Koniecpolski camping with the Polish army at Bar, led the 2000 cavalry against the Tatars and forced them to retreat. He then crossed the Dniester and on 4 July at the Battle of Sasov Rog on the River Prut defeated enemy. Poles captured several Budjak mirzas, among whom was the son-in-law of Cantemir Mirza, freed all the captives and captured a large part of the loot. In August Silistrian Pasha, Abaza Pasha, led the Turkish troops came to the Polish border and encamped near Khotin . Koniecpolski with a Polish army  went out to meet the enemy and established fortified camp near the fortress Kamenetz-Podolsky. Initially Abaza Pasha entered into peace negotiations with Koniecpolski. On 19 September the Budjak Horde  under Kantemir Mirza arrived to help Abaza-Pasha. On 20 September Abaza-Pasha crossed the Dniester and Kantemir Mirza attacked the Polish position. On 23 September Abaza Pasha, confident of his numerical superiority, attacked the Polish camp near Kamenets, but was defeated and forced to retreat to Moldavia."}, "history_371": {"qa_pairs":

After the unsuccessful battle Yurii began talks with the Poles. As a result, he broke the alliance with Moscow and 17 October signed Slobodischensky Tacktat, under which the Hetmanate rejoined the Commonwealth. After learning of this switch, Tsetsyura and his Cossacks, who were with Sheremetev, also changed sides . This left Sheremetev, who was defending Chudnov in a dangerous position. At the Battle of Chudnov the Poles defeated the Russians . The fortified Russo-Cossack camp was completely encircled. During the battle Tsetsyura went over to the royal army with 2,000 Cossacks. However, most of the Left-Bank Cossack regiments remained the loyal to Moscow. .) The 15,000-man  Russian army was completely surrounded.

About 99% of the population of Lebanon includes numerous Muslim sects and Christian denominations. Because the matter of religious balance is a sensitive political issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932, before the founding of the modern Lebanese state. Consequently, there is an absence of accurate data on the relative percentages of the population of the major religions and groups. The absence of data and comprehensive statistics concerns also concerns all other demographic studies unrelated to religious balance, due to the all but total inactivity of the concerned public agencies. The only recent  statistics available are estimates based on studies made by private organizations. There are from 8.6 to 14 million Lebanese and descendants of Lebanese worldwide.

It was the result of a coup d'\u00e9tat organized by the Portuguese Republican Party. By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal's colonies, the royal family's expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties , the dictatorship of Jo\u00e3o Franco, and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock of the next day from the balcony of the Pa\u00e7os do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Te\u00f3filo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic. Among other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag.

The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire's power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, \"The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past.\" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary.

Baltimore headed to Kansas City and crushed the unprepared Chiefs 30-7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought battle."}, "nfl_3009": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, "query_id": "ac3cc5b8-0ada-47af-be47-38228e012dbb", "question": "lost have the How season this games Raiders many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, "query_id": "27ce5819-fcc8-40cb-a327-9226ec98346f", "question": "How teams halftime both points total many at were?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c1242cbf-4064-45a4-98e6-acccee5aa672", "question": "this with the How Raiders into game did come many wins?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "8438301a-61a2-4598-8a03-260dc869292d", "question": "many score the touchdowns did first half in the How Raiders?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "559d6785-d4fe-432c-8c2b-f4e15a987579", "question": "catch How did passes Roberts touchdown many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, "query_id": "b395e6ee-9edc-4658-91cd-e5678e249339", "question": "in the first points were the scored half How game many of?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "18", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Raiders"]}, "query_id": "3c0d14e5-03ab-4073-8c4a-2456ef42aa14", "question": "points Which more half, team in first Raiders or the scored Titans?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Raiders"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Raiders"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["The Raiders"]}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "ec4b3afd-fd5a-4ebb-8e92-1ea246c99e40", "question": "were How 2nd in half touchdowns scored the many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, "query_id": "da628a3a-265b-4792-9bb2-1cb787780f9c", "question": "half many first points the in How were scored?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " The Raiders started well in Tennessee, taking a 13-6 lead at halftime over the Titans on a touchdown pass from Carr to Crabtree.

Oakland drove late in the game looking for the winning score and appeared to have been stopped on an incomplete pass in the end zone on fourth down.

Spanish troops were pushed back to Melilla, which was their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Spain still had 14,000 soldiers in Melilla. However, Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack the town. He subsequently told the writer J. Roger-Matthieu that since citizens of other European nations were residing in Melilla, it was feared they would intervene in the war should their citizens come to harm. Other reasons included the dispersal of Rifian fighters from several loosely allied tribes following the victory at Annual; and the arrival in Melilla of substantial reinforcements from the Legion and other Spanish units recalled from operations in western Morocco. By the end of August Spanish forces at Melilla numbered 36,000 under General Jose Sanjurjo and the slow process of recovering the lost territory could begin. Thus the Spanish could keep their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Later Abd el-Krim would admit: \"I bitterly regret this order. It was my biggest mistake. All the following tenor of events happened because of this mistake.\" By January 1922 the Spanish had retaken their major fort at Monte Arruit  and had reoccupied the coastal plain as far as Tistutin and Batel. The Rifian forces had consolidated their hold of the inland mountains and stalemate was reached. The Spanish military suffered losses even at sea; in March the transport ship Juan de Joanes was sunk in Alhucemas Bay by Riffian coastal batteries, and in August 1923, while shelling Riffian positions, the battleship Espa\u00f1a ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas and was eventually scrapped in situ.

By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of Siam. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765-1766 and 1766-1767 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military manoeuvres nationwide in both countries. The third invasion  led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from Ava. But the Bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier.

In 1665-66 they built a seminary in Ayutthaya with the approval of King Narai, the Seminary of Saint Joseph . In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand. Narai welcomed these missionaries, providing them with land for a church, a mission-house and a seminary .Bishops Lambert and Ballue established a Western hospital in Thailand in 1669 at Ayutthaya, with Father Laneau as the head doctor. The hospital provided medical care to about 200-300 people daily. During a 1670 trip to France, Pallu obtained from Louis XIV a letter to King Narai, which, together with a letter from the Pope, he remitted in Ayutthaya in October 1673 and which was received with great reverence. These contacts were closely associated with the development of French influence in South Asia, and especially with the establishment of the French East India Company in 1664, and the development of colonial French India."}, "history_936": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "14", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c611f419-dfba-4b96-ba6a-998f0f242708",

Buccaneers hosted the Titans at Raymond James Stadium, their second inter-conference matchup in two weeks. Buccaneers running back Earnest Graham was a part of the starting lineup for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Michael Pittman, who sat out the game. The first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team scoring in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Buccaneers 32-yard line, but quarterback Vince Young fumbled the ball and the Buccaneers recovered. Jeff Garcia connected on a 39-yard pass play to Michael Clayton, to help set up a 23-yard Matt Bryant field goal, the first points of the game. Moments later, Phillip Buchanon intercepted Vince Young with 1:29 remaining in the half, to maintain a 3-0 halftime lead. Tennessee took the second half kickoff, and executed a 12-play, 45-yard drive which resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He would have to leave the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Collins drove the Titans to the Buccaneers 23-yard line. For the second time, Ronde Barber intercepted Collins, this time in the endzone, but it was again ruled incomplete after review. The drive continued, and with 1:24 remaining, LenDale White tied the game 10-10 with a touchdown run. With only one timeout, Garcia drove the Buccaneers 55 yards on seven plays.

In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready.

The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in

the Toungoo Dynasty and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom based in Pegu . Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam.  Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban  and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava  to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.  While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended  to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma.  Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754. Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755, and captured Pegu in 1757, ending the 17-year-old Mon kingdom."}, "history_4007": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "493dcb4a-ff4c-4d7b-afaa-faddfa3324a9", "question": "Champagne many than put for months lee to on age vintage How more non?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}, "query_id": "4e7e4d7d-4ae6-4f91-bb9c-4cf832224816", "question": "ratings How Crus Premier more Crus many higher percentage than recieve did Deuxi\u00e8me?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "For each vintage, the CIVC rated the villages of the area based on the quality of their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to determine the price and the percentage of the price that growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90\u201399% ratings while Deuxi\u00e8me Crus received 80\u201389% ratings. Under appellation rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) of grapes can be pressed (wine) to create up to 673 gallons (US) (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuv\u00e9e and the next 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine is a blend of vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging.

This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army.

In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem.

While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family.

Madison in 1875, larger mills were built. The first Madison Woolen Mill was constructed in 1881 near the bridge between Madison and Anson, with the firm's second mill built nearby in 1887. In 1890, the Manufacturing Investment Company built a sulfite mill, but it failed. It was taken over in 1899 by the Great Northern Paper Company, which rebuilt the plant to produce wood pulp and paper. Like many New England textile manufacturers, the town's woolen mills eventually went out of business, but the pulp and paper mill remains today as the Madison Paper Industries which will close by May 2016 due to low demand for supercalender paper and Canadian competition. In 1901, Lakewood Summer Theatre opened in East Madison on the western side of Lake Wesserunsett. Since 1967 it has been the official summer theatre of Maine, and the oldest continually operating summer theatre in America. Actors who have performed at Lakewood include John Travolta, Carol Channing, and Phyllis Diller Completed in 2007 is the largest structure by volume in Maine, the Backyard Farms greenhouse that covers 24 acres ."}, "history_1884": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["English people"]}, "query_id": "744f2e5b-2f14-41fa-ac72-ecb96b2f95dc",

However, the French officials supported that the Illinois, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Huron were against the Foxes. As a result, the peace treaty from 1726 was annulled in the summer of 1727.:215 With this peace treaty being annulled, the Fox declared war to the French and all their Indian allies. For the next four years, the French invested a lot of money and descended, with their allies, on Fox villages with an extreme advantage.:216 The French pursued destruction of the Fox to such an extent as to damage their relations with other tribes. The Sioux and the Iowas refused the Fox sanctuary.:218 By the summer of 1730, the Fox population was weakening and continued to be attacked until the Sauk finally granted them sanctuary. The Sauk and Fox fought off the French with the help of western Indians, who were aware of Beauharnois plan for decimation.:219 This final push would cause Beauharnois to grant a \"General Pardon\" in 1738 and peace to be restored.:219 Their historical feuds with New France encouraged many Sauk and Fox warriors to develop kinship ties with France's rivals, the British.

On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20-14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three.

The Patriots opened the game with a 14-play, 78-yard drive culminating in a Gostkowski 20-yard field goal. After a 65-yard drive brought them to the Patriots' 1-yard line, the Browns failed to score on two downs before quarterback Derek Anderson threw an interception to linebacker Junior Seau on third down. Following a Patriots three-and-out, a Samuel interception on the first play of the Browns' next drive gave the Patriots the ball at the Browns' 34-yard line. Brady quickly turned the turnover into points, throwing a 34-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth to give the Patriots a 10-0 lead. The Browns would then punt on their next drive. On the first drive of the second quarter, the Patriots would move into Browns territory but were forced to punt, giving the Browns the ball at their own 12-yard line. After a 36-yard punt by Scott Player, the Patriots began their ensuing drive from their own 49-yard line. They would advance to the Browns' 4-yard line, but a Morris run for a loss forced a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Browns' next drive showed promise after Anderson moved the team from their own 10-yard line to the 46-yard line, but following the two-minute warning a false start penalty and then an interception by Seau, his second of the game, ended the advance. With good field position, Brady moved the 25 necessary yards in three plays, taking a 20-0 lead on a 7-yard Watson touchdown reception. A Bruschi sack then forced the Browns to take a knee to end the half. In the second half, both teams exchanged punts before the Browns began an 8-play, 56-yard drive that got them on the scoreboard, with Phil Dawson kicking a 42-yard field goal. Neither team could advance past midfield until the closing minutes of the quarter. The Browns would then score their first touchdown of the day, on a 21-yard strike from Anderson to wide receiver Tim Carter. The Patriots would respond with their own touchdown drive, taking a 27-10 lead on a 25-yard touchdown catch by Watson. After an exchange of punts gave the Browns the ball at the Patriots' 35-yard line, Anderson threw his second touchdown pass of the day, this one good for 14&#160;yards to tight end Kellen Winslow II to pull the Browns to within 10 points. The Patriots were able to hold the ball for the next five minutes, but could not score, with a Brady pass to Vrabel falling incomplete on fourth down from the Browns' 4-yard line. However, this meant the Browns had to begin their next drive from that spot, and on the first play, Winslow fumbled a 15-yard catch, which was recovered by Gay and returned for a touchdown. The Browns reached the Patriots' 10-yard line on the final possession of the game, but could not score, ending the game at 34-17, giving the Patriots their fifth win of the season as they improved to 5-0.

After a scoreless second quarter, Pittsburgh answered in the third quarter with a 45-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham.  Baltimore would respond with kicker Billy Cundiff getting a 24-yard field goal.  After adding a 19-yarder from Suisham, the Steelers defense would set up a 1st and Goal after safety Troy Polamalu stripped the ball from Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco with less than three and a half minutes to go, safety Troy Polamalu's sack on Flacco forced a fumble, allowing linebacker LaMarr Woodley to recover the ball and return it to the Baltimore 9, which was followed by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger finding running back Isaac Redman on a 9-yard touchdown pass on third down.  The Ravens tried to rally, but Pittsburgh's defense held on to prevail with the victory.

Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies , the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops, 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from South Yemen, also airlifted to reinforce Harar. The Ethiopians prevailed at Harar, Dire Dawa, Jijiga and began to push the Somalis out of the Ogaden systematically. By March 1978, the Ethiopians had captured almost all of the Ogaden, prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region. With 1/3 of the initial Somali National Army invasion force killed and 1/2 of the Somali Airforce destroyed, the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population.

Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over.

Ethiopia grew weaker. In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg , marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia. One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front  operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror . Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist-Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977. In June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, Barre strongly denied this, saying SNA \"volunteers\" were being allowed to help the WSLF."}, "history_515": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "52500", "spans": []}, "query_id": "be9b35ce-ee89-4829-b853-30fd59c317c2", "question": "Harar many Battle of the Ethiopian on side at the How were?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "52500", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "90fe8520-d67a-4d5a-a766-6554ae136e37", "question": "How did the Harar to attempt many forces years capture SNA-WSLF?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "0bfd48cd-87d3-4615-ba0f-3ee038ef5db2", "question": "into How areas many non-Somali defenders were pushed the?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "52500", "spans": []}, "query_id": "834b4bfa-6bd1-4a04-b80a-c5705edf9879", "question": "side teh on many in Harar all the Battle of Ethiopian were during men How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "52500", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "52500", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "40000", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "The greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September , in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place. From October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the Battle of Harar, where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied artillery and armor; backed by 1500 Soviet \"advisors\" and 11,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack."}, "history_3106": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7220", "spans": []}, "query_id": "5f7a3431-37a5-400f-8a76-67fb2303ed8b", "question": "income more the median median many the dollars to income How compared family family was?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7220", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["males"]}, "query_id": "a871f145-8704-4ae8-a990-c8453f1de73b", "question": "had income, median a males or gender females higher Which?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Males"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["males"]}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10364", "spans": []}, "query_id": "8b61d6cb-1f00-41d3-a575-475928f863c4", "question": "income the to the male income many female compared median dollars more was median How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10364", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "10364", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "85.90", "spans": []}, "query_id": "03473c47-13a1-477f-b565-71f0c3aaf1c9", "question": "not population of was the the below poverty line many percent How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "85.9", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "85.90", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["under age 18"]}, "query_id": "b652160d-68c7-481f-b555-d198f517397a", "question": "older under 65 percentage age a group those age Which had higher living those or or below poverty line, the 18 age?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["those under age 18"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["under age 18"]}]}], "passage": "While 2015 estimates place the median household income for Cooke County at $53,552, past estimates showed the median household income to be $37,649, with the median family income being $44,869.

Around 500 colonists were killed, but that number represented a relatively low percent of the overall population, as opposed to the earlier massacre . However, Opechancanough, still preferring to use Powhatan tactics, did not make any major follow-up to this attack. This was followed by a last effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched against the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan proper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the Chowanoke and Secotan. In February 1645, the colony ordered the construction of three frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the Chickahominy, and Fort Royal at the falls of the York. In August, Governor William Berkeley stormed Opechancanough's stronghold and captured him. All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to Tangier Island. Opechancanough, around 92 years old, was taken to Jamestown where he was shot in the back by a guard. Opechancanough's death resulted in the disintegration of the Powhatan Confederacy into its component tribes, whom the colonists continued to attack. In March 1646, the colony decided to build a fourth frontier fort, Fort Henry, at the falls of the Appomattox, where the modern city of Petersburg is located."}, "history_2752": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "493.2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "22bdfbe3-5dcf-4ff4-bb07-ec9a9dba574b", "question": "many million Oshkosh announce How in did dollars 2017-2018?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "258", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "493.2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["2015-2016"]}, "query_id": "1120cb29-095e-4e85-a6ef-84b4cc09523b", "question": "more Did Oshkosh 2015-2016 2016-2017 or award announce in dollars?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["2015-2016"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["2015-2016"]}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "716.8", "spans": []}, "query_id": "111f640e-20c5-4176-abd9-7779f170f7be", "question": "in How more announced were dollars 2015-2016 million 2017-2018 of in many than?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "172", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "716.8", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "On 19 June 2015, Oshkosh Defense announced the U.S. Army had awarded the company a five-year requirements contract worth a potential $780 million to Recapitalize (Recap) its Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV).

first demarcation line on June 18. The line, drawn about 5\u00a0km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35\u00a0km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100\u00a0km  wide front moving 20-30\u00a0km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. It was approved by the Entente on July 26. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3. Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwa\u0142ki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7\u00a0km  west. Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwa\u0142ki Regions respectively. German administration, which had not yet retreated from the Suwa\u0142ki Region, also opposed the Foch Line. The new line did not immediately halt the hostilities.

In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record.

In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new \"Academic Library\" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Viennas University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries."},

On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. Citing between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jacksons bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Rosss ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \"Sleek by 50\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm of failing to \"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case.\""}, "nfl_1193": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "589ca12d-a675-4b67-b09b-f6bfac469546", "question": "Giants the points How many did win by?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "12", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c584f463-800e-491e-9d80-b0c3a43059ca", "question": "York conversion, on New points missed the the were many Giants After two-point ahead how?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "12", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "12", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "75e4c58c-4636-4113-9919-bd30d5ed2b17", "question": "game How the points the lose did by many Eagles?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "67", "spans": []}, "query_id": "5df73477-b828-45da-a5d0-8161a972c8fc", "question": "How many total points were scored in?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "67", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "67", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "21bd3d40-e727-4343-a595-8ad879583229", "question": "by How win points the Giants did many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c03448e0-3a65-48a5-a277-aab17898bc64", "question": "points many Giants by How the did win?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "37", "spans": []}, "query_id": "612cf04c-b601-44ba-b4a0-4b9af9346046", "question": "How points half scored in were many first the?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "37", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "37", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " The Eagles, who had not won on prime time in two years, faced off against the defending Super Bowl champion   New York Giants on a Sunday night game at Lincoln Financial Field.  Mike Patterson batted up and intercepted Eli Manning, returning the ball inside the New York 10-yard line.  Two plays later DeSean Jackson took the direct snap and rushed 9-yards, diving to the pylon for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game.  Manning then led the Giants up the field and he found Plaxico Burress for a 17-yard touchdown.  The Eagles fumbled the kickoff, and New York cashed in for a field goal.  On New York's next drive, Manning capped off another long drive with a short touchdown pass to Kevin Boss to take a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter.  A fumble by Giant rusher Brandon Jacobs gave Philadelphia the ball in New York territory.  Six plays later, Donovan McNabb completed a 10-yard pass to Jason Avant for an Eagle touchdown.  Sam Madison picked off McNabb deep in Eagle territory on the next drive, but the Giants settled for a field goal to make it 20-14.  McNabb ran the two-minute drill before the half to get the Eagles a 29-yard field goal before halftime, narrowing the score to 20-17.  After a good kickoff return by rookie Quintin Demps, the Eagles navigated the short field for another touchdown, this one a fade to Hank Baskett and a 24-20 Philadelphia lead.  The Giants, continuing to have success with their ground game, drove down the field.  On a critical 3rd-and-10 from the Eagle 20-yard line, Manning completed a 17-yard pass to Boss, but was flagged for crossing the line of scrimmage.  Giants' coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call, and it was reversed, giving New York 1st-and-goal.  They scored when Jacobs powered forward on a 3-yard run.  Another long Giant drive led to a field goal early in the fourth quarter making it 30-24 Giants.  The Giants scored again on their next drive, a 3-yard rush by Jacobs.  Andy Reid challenged consecutive plays at the end of the drive, but lost both of them, leaving the Eagles with only one timeout, 9:30 left to play, and a 36-24 deficit (after New York missed on the two-point conversion).  A 32-yard completion to DeSean Jackson jump-started the offense, and McNabb hit Kevin Curtis for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth down to keep Philadelphia alive.

economic condition and the general political situation. They complained of peonage, land use, easements on the woods and the commons as well as ecclesiastical requirements of service and payment. The city set up a committee of villagers to discuss their issues, expecting to see a checklist of specific and trivial demands. Unexpectedly, the peasants delivered a uniform declaration that struck at the pillars of the peasant-magisterial relationship. Twelve articles clearly and consistently outlined their grievances. The council rejected many of the demands. Historians have generally concluded that the articles of Memmingen became the basis for the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation of 20 March 1525. A single Swabian contingent, close to 200 horse and 1,000 foot soldiers, however, could not deal with the size of the disturbance. By 1525, the uprisings in the Black Forest, the Breisgau, Hegau, Sundgau, and Alsace alone required a substantial muster of 3,000 foot and 300 horse soldiers."}, "nfl_29": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer":

RB Jamal Lewis got the team's first points as he ran into the endzone on a four-yard touchdown strike in the first quarter. Then, in the second quarter, CB Chris McAlister intercepted a pass from Tampa Bay QB Chris Simms and ran 60 yards for another touchdown. Rookie Haloti Ngata recorded his first career interception and also returned for 60 yards to set up kicker Matt Stover with a 20-yard field goal to put the Ravens up 17-0 at halftime. Baltimore continued to suppress Tampa Bay in the second half, as Stover kicked a 42-yard field goal in the third quarter to put Baltimore up 20-0. In the fourth quarter, McNair put the game away with a 4-yard pass to TE Daniel Wilcox. While the Ravens offense had a very good start to the 2006 season, the defense also showed much promise, as they forced Simms into throwing three interceptions and limited star RB Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams to just 22 yards on eight carries. For his efforts in this game Ray Lewis was named NFL Defensive Player of the Week after recording 10 tackles and a sack.

The main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd , the then-capital of Russia, where longstanding discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing on 23 February Old Style . Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days, involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes, the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S.  mutinous Russian Army forces sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later the Czar Nicholas II abdicated, ending Romanov dynastic rule and the Russian Empire. A Russian Provisional Government under Prince Georgy Lvov replaced the Russian Council of Ministers. The revolution appeared to break out without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914.

their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints."}, "nfl_1515": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""},

With a win, the Vikings would be one game behind New Orleans to clinch homefield advantage. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina got on the board with quarterback Matt Moore finding fullback Brad Hoover on a 1-yard TD pass. The extra point attempt was blocked, however. The Vikings then took the lead later in the quarter with running back Adrian Peterson's 4-yard TD run. After yet another scoreless quarter, it was all Carolina as Matt Moore completed a 42-yard TD pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, as well as running back Jonathan Stewart running in a 3-yard TD, as well as catching a 2-yard TD pass from Moore. With the loss, the Vikings fell to 11-3. Reports surfaced after the game suggesting that there was tension between Vikings quarterback Brett Favre and head coach Brad Childress.

Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover."}, "nfl_3571": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "b0f953f9-9646-496d-898f-d02e0a577e6d", "question": "playoffs  Going many it had years since into reached the 1994 last had playoffs, how the Suns been the?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "17", "spans": []}, "query_id": "f46d7e9f-5583-4da1-933a-163ef4ab0b82", "question": "and Stewart Shannon Evans had many hit home runs in Tom How total?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "17", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "17", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "3dbbac29-8464-41aa-a2cb-37a24d5aafd3", "question": "runs more home hit had many than Jones How Delacruz?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "8", "spans": []}, "query_id": "d5a43b55-ae05-40c0-975f-cddc3d5a216a", "question": "How starts wins more than Steve did Sinclair many have?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "8", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "8", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "In 1994, the Suns reached the playoffs for the first time since 1991.

In July 1586, the Duke of Parma approached and surrounded the city; by some irony, Agnes' cousin, Karl von Mansfeld and his troops were a part of the Spanish force assembled against Neuss.

According to the protocols of war generally accepted in 1586, Parma requested the capitulation of the city prior to the cannonade. Cloedt declined to capitulate, politely. The next day, being the feast of St. James, and the patron day for the Spanish, the bombardment was not initiated, although mendacious reports circulated in the Spanish camp that the Protestants had

In the second quarter, the Panthers increased its lead with Kasay kicking a 43-yard field goal. The Cardinals would get on the board with RB Edgerrin James getting a 23-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Carolina responded with Kasay getting a 24-yard field goal, yet Arizona answered with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 50-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Testaverde completed a 65-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith, increasing his consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass record to 21-straight. Afterwards, the Panthers sealed the win with Kasay nailing a 45-yard field goal, while RB DeAngelo Williams got a 13-yard TD run.

Jeff Joniak wrote a goal of the Bears offense would be to get into scoring position; since Mitchell Trubisky became the starter, the offense had entered the red zone only twice in three games, with both trips ending in field goals. Upon reaching the 20-yard line, using the running game would be ideal; Jordan Howard ranked fifth in the league in rushing, second in yards after contact, and led the offense rushing first downs with 32. In contrast, the Saints defense ranked 30th in rushing yards allowed per carry. Joniak also emphasized the need for Trubisky to tune out the loud Superdome crowd and lead the offense without making errors. For the defense, it faced Drew Brees, who, according to Joniak, was to be pressured quickly if the Bears were to succeed - while being blitzed, Brees was intercepted three times and sacked twice. Otherwise, Brees was successful in quickly passing the ball for gains of six yards in a fast-paced offense. Turnovers were also priority; in the last two games, the Bears had forced six and scored on three, and while Brees had recorded turnovers in his last two games, the Saints still had the fifth-best turnover difference. On the Saints' opening possession, Will Lutz was lining up for a 32-yard field goal attempt when Kyle Fuller was penalized for jumping offsides. This set up Alvin Kamara's eight-yard touchdown run to put New Orleans up by seven points. After the next two drives resulted in punts, Connor Barth made a 27-yard field goal in the second quarter, though Mark Ingram Jr. scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Barth missed a 48-yard field goal wide left late in the first half as the Bears entered halftime with an 11-point deficit. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who landed on his knee and dislocated it in the process. The touchdown was eventually nullified when referee Carl Cheffers determined Miller had let go of the ball in pain while on the ground. The Bears were forced to settle for Barth's 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45-yard field goal to increase the lead to 17-6. With 7:32 remaining in the game, Jonathan Bullard stripped Ingram and Christian Jones recovered the fumble. Aided by Trubisky's 46-yard run, Tarik Cohen dove into the end zone from the Saints' one-yard line to score the offense's first touchdown in 25 series (dating back to the Baltimore game). The Bears failed to score on the two-point conversion but were just five points down. Chicago forced another takeaway when Adrian Amos stripped and recovered the ball from Ingram with 2:12 left. Although the Bears turned the ball over on downs, they had another chance after Lutz's 49-yard field goal put them behind by eight points. However, Trubisky's pass for Tre McBride was intercepted by Marshon Lattimore to seal the loss. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center New Orleans for treatment. In addition to a dislocated knee, Miller was revealed to have torn the popliteal artery in his region, an injury that is common in car accidents and raised the possibility of amputation. Vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The overturning of Miller's catch was controversial. Cheffers defended the call, stating when Miller was falling to the turf, he \"has to survive the ground. He went to the ground, he temporarily lost control of the ball. The ball hit the ground; therefore it's incomplete.\" The NFL's Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron also maintained Miller had not completed the catch, but predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino argued otherwise. \"At some point the process of the catch ends, and it ends when he rolls over on the ground with control. It was ruled a catch on the field. I didn't see anything definitive to overturn it and quite frankly, if it had been ruled incomplete on the field, if it had been me in the command center, I would have reversed it to a catch,\" Blandino said.

Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead.

The average salary among evacuees was lower than the general average, as compared to above average before the disengagement. In addition to a drop in salary, the evacuees also suffered a drop in their standard of living due to the increased price of goods and services in their places of residence as compared to the settlements. Following the disengagement, settlers were temporarily relocated to hotels, sometimes for as long as half a year, before moving to mobile homes as temporary housing known as caravillas, before they could build proper homes. By June 2014, about 60% of evacuees were still living in these caravillas. Only 40% had moved to permanent housing, although construction of permanent settlements for the evacuees continues to progress. By July 2014, eleven towns for the evacuees had been completed with the expellees joining ten additional towns. Many of the permanent settlements under construction were given names reminiscent of the former Gaza settlements. By August 2014, unemployment among evacuees had dropped to 18%.

Knopf Sr. along with Blanche Knopf, on a $5,000 advance from his father, Samuel Knopf. The first office was located in New York's Candler Building. The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice-president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer. From the start, Knopf focused on European translations and high-brow works of literature. Among their initial publications were French author \u00c9mile Augier's Four Plays, Russian writer Nikolai Gogol's Taras Bulba, Polish novelist Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski's novel Homo Sapiens, and French writer Guy de Maupassant's Yvette, a novelette, and Ten Other Stories. During World War I these books were cheap to obtain and helped establish Knopf as an American firm publishing European works. Their first bestseller was a new edition of Green Mansions, a novel by W. H. Hudson which went through nine printings by 1919 and sold over 20,000 copies. Their first original American novel, The Three Black Pennys by Joseph Hergesheimer, was published in 1917."}, "nfl_194": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "29", "spans": []}, "query_id": "6f9d4d81-04f0-4ed7-8120-87cc56e6a5f7", "question": "completions How Peyton have did many Manning?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "29", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "870a66da-55ab-48c6-870a-7e3abac88339", "question": "by were many in total kicked field goals both How teams?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "36", "spans": []}, "query_id": "2c7b8dd6-1b4b-4a4f-ab75-846ee3d0fbb5", "question": "Peyton passes throw Manning many How did?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "36", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "bdcc289c-0316-4dfa-81e9-e36e777b9a28", "question": "second Harrison How score the did Marvin in touchdowns many quarter?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "145982dd-a747-4d5f-83c1-a5accb48bb4e", "question": "did quarter throw Manning in third the How many touchdown passes?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "cb558cfc-9787-452a-91f7-2ff9c865f238", "question": "kick goals many Vinatieri field Adam did How 40 over yards?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}, "query_id": "765ffe7f-79dd-49d5-a846-60fd173b0a03", "question": "How did interceptions Manning many Peyton have?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " Hoping to rebound from their blowout road loss to the Jaguars, the Colts went home for a Monday Night Football matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals.

In the second quarter, the Colts began their breakout with QB Peyton Manning completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR Marvin Harrison. Harrison would end up catching three touchdown passes in this game. Even though Cincinnati responded with 12-yard touchdown run by RB Rudi Johnson, Indianapolis responded with Manning completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Harrison. In the third quarter, the Bengals converted another field goal, and the Colts continued their power with Manning completing another touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison. Afterwards, Manning would complete another touchdown pass, this one an 18-yarder to WR Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals' only response was another field goal. After that last field goal by Shayne Graham, Adam Vinatieri responded with a 44-yard field goal to close out the game. With the win, the Colts improved to 11-3. Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 29 of 36 for 282 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, while Bengals QB Carson Palmer was 14 of 28 for 176 passing yards.

or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person\u2019s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical. They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) estimates that more than 333,000 cosmetic procedures were performed on patients 18 years of age or younger in the US in 2005 compared to approx. 14,000 in 1996. This is significant because it encourages younger people to continue these procedures later in life. The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses ethnic plastic surgery in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. In Europe, the second largest market for cosmetic procedures, cosmetic surgery is a $2.2 billion business. Of 1191 UK newspaper articles, 89% used the term 'plastic surgery' in the context of cosmetic surgery.

The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, whereby King Louis II was killed. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand of Austria by his marriage with Anne of Bohemia and Hungary claimed the succession, he was enfoffed with the Bohemian kingdom by his elder brother Emperor Charles V and also reached the consent of the Hungarian magnates.

On the Jets' first possession of the second half, following a Houston punt, Pennington completed long passes to Chris Baker and Cotchery before finding Coles on a 12-yard touchdown pass. On the Jets' next drive, fans everywhere held their breath when Pennington was drilled by Mario Williams while releasing a pass and was slow to get up.

The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors.

The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire's power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, \"The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past.\" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary. Other scholars theorise that the suppression of Hungary simply marked the prologue to a later, premeditated invasion of Europe."}, "nfl_669": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "",

for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run.  The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.  Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history).

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of J\u00e4gerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of J\u00e4gerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life.

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks.

The 49ers only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20-17 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21-10, shut out the Chicago Bears 23-0 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38-16.

black-white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45-94.15, 102.29-104.57 and 92.30-95.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the crack epidemic, the degradation of African-American family structure, the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to No Child Left Behind), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to globalization and minimum wage increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and \"environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves.\" To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of \"meritoric principles\" and

He advanced to Plo\u010dnik near Prokuplje but could not detect the position of that army, and believed that there was none. At that time, many akinjis  lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages by disobeying orders. \u015eahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces. Suddenly an allied army with 30,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with \u015eahin Bey who barely escaped with his life. Then the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering; unprepared, ill-disciplined, surprised akinjis couldn't do anything without their general. Only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107 participated in this battle and distinguished himself, and was wounded by an Ottoman arrow. According to some, such as Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klai\u0107, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops.

This led to the two churches uniting with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands  to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004. The 2004 merger led to a separation in which a number of congregations and members of the Dutch Reformed Church separated to form the Restored Reformed Church . Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 in about 120 local congregations served by 88 ministers. The Restored Reformed Church disapproves of the pluralistic nature of the merged church, which they allege contains partly contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions.

Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the worlds tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, C\u00e9sar Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise Tower block construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m\u00b2) of office space with 16 million square feet (1,500,000 m\u00b2) of class A office space."}, "history_1898": {"qa_pairs":

The imperial inspector Zhao Wenhua reiterated the emperor's wishes that surrender was not an option, so Hu Zongxian made a show of receiving Xu Hai's surrender while waiting for the opportune moment to strike. In the meantime Xu Hai had settled in the Shen Family Estate  of Pinghu, where he recruited up to 300 new followers by hosting banquets for his neighbours, adding to the thousand or more raiders still under his command and remnants of Chen Dong's group next to the estate. He grew increasingly recalcitrant, refusing an invitation to an official Mid-Autumn party and even killing an envoy from Hu Zongxian. In late September, reinforcements from Baojing and Yongshun arrived and began small-scale skirmishes around the Shen Family Estate. Before commencing the final attack, Hu Zongxian persuaded his captive Chen Dong to write a letter to his followers encamped next to Xu Hai's forces, warning them that Xu Hai was conspiring with government troops to wipe them out in a pincer operation. This provoked Chen Dong's men into attacking Xu Hai's group on September 27, upon which government forces entered the fray from all directions, killing indiscriminately. On September 29, the battle ended with up to 1600 marauders killed in the estate, and Xu Hai's body was found in a nearby stream.

losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots

Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in \"garbage time\" to make the final score 38-21.  Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns.

In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26-28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000-18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an 1941 Bila Tserkva massacre in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Paul Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000-15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared.

The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's   heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1."}, "nfl_336": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year":

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne. Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000."}, "nfl_778": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month":

Also, with both teams at 55 wins a piece, the Steelers would take the lead in the rivalry for the first time in the 57-year history of the rivalry. Pittsburgh got off to a fast start in the first quarter as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Hines Ward. Later, kicker Jeff Reed made a 26-yard field goal, while Roethlisberger completed a 40-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes.  After a scoreless second quarter, the Steelers went right back to work in the third quarter, as Roethlisberger completed a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Matt Spaeth.  Afterwards, the Browns got their only score of the game as QB Derek Anderson completed a 1-yard TD pass to FB Lawrence Vickers.  Pittsburgh put the game well out of reach as Roethlisberger threw his career-best 4th touchdown pass of the game, a 22-yard strike to TE Heath Miller.  In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh wrapped up the win with Reed's 31-yard field goal. With the win, the Steelers began the year at 1-0, gave Mike Tomlin his first win as a head coach, and took the lead in the Rust Belt series with win #56.

1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's Flare and Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats. Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF. In February 1999, MorphInk 99 was introduced, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers' kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5. Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites. In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format . Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats , this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions. In June 2009, Adobe launched the Open Screen Project , which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software.

Following a three and out forced by the Colts defense, Andrew Luck again drove the offense down the field, this time scoring on a touchdown throw Ahmad Bradshaw, extending the Colts' lead to 10-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Colts again extended their lead early in the second quarter on a pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Jaguars were again stopped by the Colts defense on their next offensive possession, with the Colts defense preventing the Jaguars for converting a first down on their first three possessions. The Colts' offense, though they would deep into Jaguars' territory, were forced to settle for Vinatieri field goals on their next two offensive possessions, giving them a 23-0 lead. After a fumble recovery by Darius Butler late in the first half, they were set up with good field position in Jaguars territory. A Luck touchdown pass to Coby Fleener extended the Colts' lead to 30-0 at halftime. After struggling to move the ball in the first half, the Jaguars replaced quarterback Chad Henne with rookie Blake Bortles. The Jaguars were able to convert a first down on their first drive of the half, though they were forced to punt following a penalty that sent them back to midfield. On the Jaguars' next possession, they again drove into Colts' territory, enough to get their first points of the game on a 41-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. At the end of the third quarter, the Colts continued to hold a commanding 30-3 lead. The Colts scored their first points of the second half on a pass from Luck to Hakeem Nicks early in the fourth quarter. Bortles threw his first career touchdown pass on the Jaguars' next possession, throwing it to Allen Hurns. With the large lead late in the game, the Colts replaced Luck with backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. Late in the fourth quarter the Colts defense extended the lead, with an interception returned for a touchdown by Greg Toler. A Bortles pass to Cecil Shorts III was the last scoring play of the game, giving the Colts the 44-17 win. At the end of the game, Andrew Luck completed 31 of 39 pass attempts for 370 yards and four touchdown passes, which earned him the honor of AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

Public sympathies had shifted and Cumberland's insistence on severity earned him the nickname 'Butcher' from a City of London alderman. The last Jacobite to be executed was Doctor Archibald Cameron, younger brother of Lochiel. Convicted of treason for his part in the 45, he escaped into exile; when he returned to Scotland in March 1753, he was allegedly betrayed by members of his own clan and executed in London on 7 June."}, "history_2530": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "650000", "spans": []}, "query_id": "fddedd1a-3c9a-49c8-ac8b-83465076206c", "question": "France Tunisians during residing were many in How Sfax than in people Tunis and there were more 1994?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "650000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "650000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}, "query_id": "f676f351-90da-440c-8608-959fa528250c", "question": "Tunis live how to Approximately Sfax people more in many compared?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, "query_id": "bae7a46c-6ac9-45bb-a7de-07d69fe946b7", "question": "the 2007 How dropped rate from the 1960s growth has to many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "5", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["female"]}, "query_id": "ad243a7e-0f0f-40af-a1a7-a46265528668", "question": "or life expectancy, has a Which females longer males group?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["female"]}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["female"]}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}, "query_id": "1c7e95d9-49aa-40d2-b4f4-c7f9f328673a", "question": "more Sfax lived people How Tunis than in many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "450000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "af9bafc1-9737-4218-88b2-27c5a121ce6f", "question": "than men is of years longer the women many How life expectancy?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "97", "spans": []}, "query_id": "060c47c9-5bb4-41c7-8a17-1bb8034b0f4c", "question": "more in are than Christian many people, Islam How rather percentage,?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "97", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "97", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "18", "spans": []}, "query_id": "7040bda7-b818-44bd-8f2e-3e2951334fdc", "question": "than many more, are females How percent, in males literate?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "18", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1.7", "spans": []}, "query_id": "2a54f7f8-b7c9-460a-b55a-7c86e4a382e2", "question": "points many percentage 2006 in How compared in in to were unemployed fewer, 2000?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1.7", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1.7", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, "query_id": "a00c92df-4a91-4cf6-a4eb-d234b4d57de8", "question": "many in were the on mobile more, had internet phones How millions, then?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "Tunis, the capital, has a population of about 700,000, and the second city of Sfax approximately 250,000.

While not strictly related to the '45, the British author Joan Aiken wrote a series of children's books set in an alternative 18th-century Britain where James II was never deposed and his son James III battles constant pro-Hanoverian conspiracies. Significant screen versions include 1948's Bonnie Prince Charlie starring David Niven who summarised it as 'one of those huge, florid extravaganzas that reek of disaster from the start' and Culloden, Peter Watkins' 1964 docu-drama. In addition to the current Outlander TV series, the aftermath of the Rebellion is the theme of the now lost 1966 Dr Who series The Highlanders.

The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram.

His head was then placed on a pike and kept on display for several days. The palace was sacked and the king's entire family was taken captive. Eight hundred Badagas and some Moors of Kozhikode were beheaded, as they were considered enemies. All the vessels in the port were burnt except two vessels for the use of the king.

Ravens QB Joe Flacco entered this game with a 13-1 record against the Browns. The Ravens' defense was strong, limiting the running game to just 9 yards on the first 8 attempts, with constant blitz pressure forcing Browns QB Josh McCown to make the right reads on his passes. The Ravens led 14-3 after the first quarter and 21-9 early in the third quarter.  At that point, the Browns began to come back.  The Browns scored a touchdown to make it 21-16 heading into the 4th quarter.  Connecting with TE Gary Barnidge on an 80-yd drive in the fourth quarter, the Browns led for the first time at 22-21. Teams then traded scores, with the Ravens leading 27-22, then the Browns leading 30-27 with three minutes left in regulation.  The Ravens used those three minutes to drive down the field and tie the game with a field goal. Tied at 30 after regulation, the game headed into overtime. The Ravens got the ball first. The Browns' defense forced a 3-and-out, and Travis Benjamin set up the punt at the Brown's 35. The Ravens failed to force a punt or turnover as the Browns drove down the field to the Ravens' 14 yard line, where K Travis Coons would kick the game-winning field goal . McCown completed passes to nine different receivers; four of them&#8212;Gary Barnidge, Travis Benjamin, Andrew Hawkins and Taylor Gabriel&#8212;had six or more receptions. He finished 36/51 for a career-high 457 yards with two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. McCown also became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 300+ passing yards in three straight games.  The Browns ran the ball 25 times, with seven carries in overtime to set up the game-winning field goal by Coons, who is now 10-for-10 to start his career. With the win, the Browns improved to 2-3 and moved into 3rd place in the AFC North.  The Browns snapped a five-game road losing streak and a seven-game losing streak in Baltimore.  This was also the Browns' first overtime win since November 18, 2007, coincidentally a 33-30 road victory over the Ravens in the infamous \"Dawson Bar\" Game. For his performance, QB Josh McCown was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other.

Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea.

Almost immediately Prince Edmund departed for England, while Edward remained to see if the treaty would hold. The following month, an attempt to assassinate Edward was made. Several versions of who sent the assassin exist. According to different versions, the assassin was sent by the emir of Ramlah or by Baibars. Some legends also say that the assassin was sent by the \"Old Man of the Mountains\", leader of a heretical Muslim sect. Edward killed the assassin but received a festering wound from a poisoned dagger in the process, further delaying Edward's own departure.

Soon after the capture of Dorpat, an internal conflict arose in Novgorod. The townspeople refused to help in the fight against the knights. Soon, a split occurred among the Novgorod nobles. Expelled from the city, the nobles and the Knights captured Izborsk in 1233, but soon were expelled from the city by the Pskov army. A year later, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Novgorod returned to the Livonian lands and devastated the outskirts of the town Odenpa, triumphing over Emaj\u00f5e and forcing the Livonians to sign a peace agreement. In 1236, Lithuania had lost a Great Master of the Order of the Sword Volquin von Winterstein, and Pope Gregory IX gave his consent to the Union of the Order of the Sword with the Teutonic Knights. The master of the Order was Hermann von Balk. In December 1237, Pope Gregory IX proclaimed the second crusade against Finland. Danish king Waldemar II and the joint Masters of the Order agreed to divide Estonia and attacked Baltic Russia in June 1238 in collaboration with the Swedes.

Among them was Pontus de la Gardie, who thereafter became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War. Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peter or Per Munck, who bombarded Swedish Reval from sea in July 1569. The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe, yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led to a series of conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs.

After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive.

The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world.

Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducci\u00f3n. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducci\u00f3n town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche.

Instead, the real power rested with three former Pagan commanders of nearby Myinsaing. It was the brothers, not the nominal sovereign Kyawswa, that sent a force to retake Lower Burma in 1294 after Wareru had decided to become a vassal of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Wareru drove back the Myinsaing forces. Concerned by the increasing power of the three brothers, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognised by the Mongol emperor Tem\u00fcr Khan as viceroy of Pagan on 20 March 1297. In December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. In January 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinhkaya seized the southernmost Mongol garrisons named Nga Singu and Male, just north of modern Mandalay. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa, one of Kyawswa's sons, was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in a 12,000-strong army from Yunnan. The Mongol army reached Male on 15 January 1301, and Myinsaing on 25 January. But they could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes given by the three brothers, and began their retreat on 6 April. But the commanders were executed by the Yunnan government when they got back.

Barrios died in November, and oidor Jos\u00e9 de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration.

Am\u00e9squeta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mop\u00e1n. Captain D\u00edaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Crist\u00f3bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas.

They set out from Mop\u00e1n on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at R\u00edo Chakal. The two forces combined, giving D\u00edaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz.

Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumi\u00f1ahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.:235-237"}, "history_2857": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "",

Eli Manning finished off the 91 yard scamper with a short play-action touchdown to tight end Jeremy Shockey. The Giants would utilize a heavy pass rush to force the Falcons to punt again and after a Jay Feely field goal from 39 yards, the offense put the game away.  Manning hit Shockey on another touchdown late, finishing off the Falcons.  For the day, Manning was 17 of 30 for 180 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.  Barber rushed for 185 yards and Jacobs added 53.  Shockey re-emerged in this game with six receptions, including the two touchdowns.  Defensively, the Giants recorded seven sacks including two from Osi Umenyiora and linebacker Brandon Short.  Cornerback Sam Madison who had a rough start to the season had the interception against Vick and recovered his fumble in the first quarter.  The constant pressure and containment on Vick was the key to the Giants 27-14 victory."}, "nfl_816": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}, "query_id": "4dee88e8-03f3-4c63-a17c-73333345279f", "question": "in were many quarter the scored How points third?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "0", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "fbacb50c-3599-4877-bad3-ce7be806ee16", "question": "many quarter touchdowns were scored the in second How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " Trying to snap their six-game losing streak, the 49ers flew to Qwest Field for an NFC West rematch on Monday Night Football with the Seattle Seahawks.

The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hern\u00e1n Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, Hern\u00e1n Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion.

The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380\u00a0km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270\u00a0km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports , the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed.

never won in their franchise history. After a scoreless first quarter, the Dolphins grabbed the lead in the second quarter, with field goals of 38 and 36 yards by kicker Dan Carpenter. After a scoreless third quarter, the Dolphins extended their lead in the fourth quarter, with quarterback Matt Moore throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 43-yard field goal by Carpenter, giving Miami a 15-0 lead. However, after each team traded punts, the Broncos staged a rally with just over five minutes remaining, with quarterback Tim Tebow throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to pull to within 15-7 with 2:44 remaining. After the Broncos recovered an onside kick, they subsequently marched down the field, with Tebow connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Fells, followed by Tebow scrambling for the two-point conversion to send the game into overtime. On the Dolphins' second possession in overtime, Broncos' linebacker D. J. Williams forced a fumble off Moore, giving the Broncos possession at the Dolphins' 36-yard line. Four plays later, kicker Matt Prater, who had missed two field goals in the first half, nailed the game-winning 52-yard field goal. With the win, the Broncos earned their 400th win in franchise history, their first-ever win at Miami in eight tries, and became the first team in NFL history since the AFL-NFL merger to win a game after trailing by 15 or more points with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter."}, "history_2270": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number":

The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 17-yard touchdown pass. The Colts responded, with a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri. Following a fumble by Broncos' return specialist Trindon Holliday on a punt return, the Colts grabbed the lead, with quarterback Andrew Luck completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey. The Broncos re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with Manning throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. On the Broncos next possession, Colts' linebacker Robert Mathis forced a fumble off Manning out of the end zone, resulting in a safety. The Colts subsequently re-claimed the lead, with Luck connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Stanley Havili, then added to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Coby Fleener just before halftime. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their first three possessions of the third quarter, and the Colts took a 33-14 lead, with Luck rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. Late in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to cut into the Colts lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but the Colts responded early in the fourth quarter, with a 52-yard field goal by Vinatieri. Trailing 36-17, the Broncos attempted a rally, with Manning connecting on a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Knowshon Moreno. The latter score occurred after Broncos' safety Duke Ihenacho forced a fumble off Colts' running back Trent Richardson deep in Colts' territory. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Colts next possession. However, with 7:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, Manning's arm was hit by Colts' linebacker Erik Walden, and his pass was subsequently intercepted by linebacker Pat Angerer deep in Broncos' territory. Four plays later, a Vinatieri 42-yard field goal gave the Colts a 39-30 lead with 6:06 remaining. Eight plays into the Broncos' next possession, running back Ronnie Hillman lost a fumble at the Colts' 3-yard line at the 3:15 mark of the fourth quarter, just as the Broncos were attempting to narrow the Colts' lead. The Colts' offense subsequently ran time off the clock, forcing the Broncos to burn all three of their team timeouts. The Broncos tried a desperation rally with 1:28 remaining, with Prater nailing a 47-yard field goal with only 17 seconds remaining. However, the ensuing onside kick was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Colts. With the loss, the Broncos' 17-game regular season winning streak was snapped. This marked Peyton Manning's first visit to Indianapolis since he was released by the Colts in March 2012.

The Redskins regained possession on a tipped Ben Roethlisberger pass that was intercepted by Cornelius Griffin early in the first quarter. The drive resulted in another field goal giving Washington a 6-0 lead over the Steelers. In the second quarter, Steelers' Jeff Reed scored on a 35-yard field goal.

Prior to the season, NFL analysts rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up Percy Harvin and San Francisco picking Anquan Boldin in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1-1 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42-13 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt. Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk Shaun Alexander would raise the 12th man flag. The game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, Earl Thomas intercepted a Colin Kaepernick pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, Russell Wilson was intercepted by rookie Eric Reid, and the tug of war continued into the second quarter. All was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2-0 lead. Later on, defensive end Cliff Avril strip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5-0 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12-0 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by Phil Dawson 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12-3 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by Richard Sherman, who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard Steven Hauschka field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety Kam Chancellor, who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29-3. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and Pete Carroll improved to 3-4 overall against the Niners, and 2-3 against bitter rival Jim Harbaugh. Seattle was now 2-0, and still unbeaten at home."}, "history_325": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id":

The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531.

Japan has around 180 000 overseas students studying at its institutions and the government has set targets to increase this to 300, 000 over the next few years. Canada has seen a large increase in the number of Indian students, where the number of Indian students rose 280% in 2010 compared to 2008. Organizations such as Learnhub are taking advantage of this growing trend of Indian international students by providing recruitment services that bring Indian students abroad. In 2012, in Canada 10 percent of university students were international students.  Canada accepted more than 100,000 international students for the first time, bringing the total number of international students in Canada to 260,000, which is nearly identical to that of Australias 280,000.

Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands.

Pennington and Bradley were both dismissed from the program in 2000, allegedly because they had given testimony on Hallstroms behalf in the wrongful termination litigation she pursued against Barker and the show. Following the departures of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar and Claudia Jordan in the 2000s, producers decided to use a rotating cast of models (up to ten) until the middle of season 37, after which the show reverted to five regular models. Since March 2008, the models include Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster and Gwendolyn Osbourne (who left in 2017); Manuela Arbel\u00e1ez joined the cast in April 2009, replacing Brandi Sherwood and James OHalloran joined the cast in December 2014. Carey does not use a collective name for the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models will be able to use the show as a \"springboard\" to further their careers. In a change from previous policy, the models appearing on a given episode are named individually in the shows credits and are formally referred as \"The Price Is Right models\" when collectively grouped at events. Since season 37, the show often uses a guest model for certain prizes, often crossing over from another CBS property or come courtesy of the company providing the prize. Some such models have been male, especially for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and used in guest appearances during the Showcase. Owing to the traditionally female demographic of daytime television shows, along with the pregnancies of Reynolds and Osbourne, CBS announced that the game show would add a male model for a week during season 41, fitting with other countries with the franchise that have used an occasional male model. The show held an internet search for the man in an online competition that featured Michael G. Richards, the shows executive producer, Reynolds, Lancaster, Osbourne and Arbel\u00e1ez serving as judges and mentors during the web series, narrated by Gray. Viewers selected the winner in October 2012. On October 5, 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Robert Scott Wilson of Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson appeared as a model on episodes through April 15, 2014. This contest was scheduled to be repeated in 2014, with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000\u2014larger than the one facing the Japanese\u2014had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time."}, "history_1316": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "20e698e1-9c93-4524-a5fd-08c7cc9b51a8", "question": "years the How on did many go war Russo-Swedish?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["Russo-Swedish War of 1656-1658"]}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "775c49ab-37b3-49a4-b26b-652142f4a615", "question": "did How War last years many the Russo-Swedish?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "d1c21001-ef7a-4d83-8249-325eb252aed5", "question": "Russo-Swedish did How War last many the years?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "The Russians advance into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led to the kingdom of Sweden invading Poland in 1655 under King Charles X.

Khmelnytsky was not against this temporary truce and supported the Tsar though he warned him of Polish furtiveness. Ivan Vyhovsky, the newly elected hetman in 1657 upon the death of Khmelnytsky, allied himself with the Poles in Sept. 1658, creating the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia.  However, the Cossacks were also beset with the start of a civil war with this Commonwealth treaty and a new Treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia in 1659. The Tsar concluded with Sweden the advantageous Treaty of Valiersar, which allowed him to resume hostilities against the Poles in October 1658, capturing Wincenty Gosiewski at the Battle of Werki.

December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France\u2014against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow \"a tyrant allied to the Turks\". On 8 July, Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier; Charles and the second Imperial army soon joined him."}, "nfl_180": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1",

The invasion force, which consisted of 3,500 Green Standard troops along with Tai-Shan militias, laid siege to Kengtung but could not match battle-hardened Burmese troops at the Kengtung garrison, led by Gen. Ne Myo Sithu. The Burmese lifted the siege and pursued the invaders into Pu'er Prefecture, and defeated them there. Ne Myo Sithu left a reinforced garrison, and returned to Ava in April 1766. Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, first tried to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's immediate recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood was pouring from his neck: \"There is no way to pay back the emperor's favor. I deserve death with my crime\". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless.

so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found Marr (automobile) under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marrs valve-in-head (Overhead valve engine) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called \"Buick Motor Company,\" moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind.

In 1335, he gained forgiveness from \u00d6z Beg and was allowed to return to his former position in Tver, however by then, the state had lost most of its influence, being replaced by the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. This return did not last long, as both Alexander and his son Fyodor were taken to Sarai and quartered in 1339. Following the execution of Alexander Vasilievich in 1331, Ivan received the duchy of Vladimir and became the sole ruler of northeastern Russia.

The second and third turnovers were forced in the third quarter on Zack Bowman's muffed punt recovery, and Brian Urlacher recovering Joique Bell's fumble. The final turnover occurred when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford's pass was intercepted by D. J. Moore. The Bears struck first on Jay Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, and Robbie Gould kicked a field goal to increase the first half score to 10-0. During the game, Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh threw Cutler to the ground, injuring his ribs. Cutler was eventually replaced by Jason Campbell for a play, before returning to the game. In the second half, Gould kicked another field goal, and prevented the Lions from scoring until the final 36 seconds of the game, when Stafford threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Broyles to narrow the margin to six points, but the Bears sealed the victory by recovering the ensuring onside kick."}, "history_1650": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "2a7434bc-8b5e-4670-8ab4-e2068d5eb24b", "question": "did County the after the take How Siege encounter of Down many at Dromore months Derry place?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "9e750081-0992-40ce-93b2-c1ba6e34bf44", "question": "Dromore, militia Down an the Williamite encounter did County after How a Derry of a months in many Protestant Siege at Jacobite route force?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "After William's landing in England, James' Lord Deputy in Ireland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell took action to ensure that all strong points in Ireland were held by garrisons of the newly recruited Irish Catholic army, loyal to James. The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly \"Redshanks\" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster."}, "history_1048": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2000", "spans": []}, "query_id": "1003bb6f-c368-40c6-9b07-5008ffac6038", "question": "was in people people died of the maximum estimate riot How the many who?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c733d13a-516b-4a26-bc34-13281a9051dd", "question": "surrender insurgents who many the burst did demand Kremlin of into How the people?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "cc1b975e-374f-435e-8977-f10fb9458c72", "question": "How surrendered was I's days many return after Alexei Pleshceyev?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "540ce13a-58d9-40a2-9e6c-e7f187e6d549", "question": "set to How did many cities the fire rebels?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9", "spans": []}, "query_id": "0955df5f-33f3-4fb2-a17e-2e8b23a50478", "question": "is many How difference burned number were between that houses maximum the the minimum and?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9000", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "9000", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "950bdee5-ce90-475f-8bc8-cdefd1817660", "question": "the of How many did people surrender the demand insurgents?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "All these problems came to a head on 1 June 1648, upon Alexei I's return to Moscow from the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra monastery. A crowd of Muscovites surrounded the Tsar and complained about the boyars and prikaz officials. Instead of hearing the petition, the royal bodyguards started dispersing the crowd, pushing them away from the Tsar. This unexpected reaction caused a major outbreak of anger among the people. On 2 June the insurgents burst into the Moscow Kremlin and demanded the surrender of Leontii Pleshcheyev , Duma diak Nazar Chistoy , boyar Boris Morozov  and his brother-in-law Pyotr Trakhaniotov . Morozov commanded the Streltsy  to drive the rioters out of the Kremlin, but they refused. When not acting as the Tsar's bodyguards, the musketeers held artisanal jobs in Moscow. This conflict of interest led them to side with the plight of the townsmen, stating that they, \"...did not want to stand in antagonistic relations with the crowd for the sake of the traitor and tyrant Pleshcheyev.\" The people would not hear the Tsar's heartfelt pleas to spare Pleshceyev and, on June 3, Alexei surrendered the official. In their fervor, the crowd did not wait for Pleshcheyev to be executed instead, \"...they cuggeled him so black and blue and with axes they cut him asunder like a fish, the pieces they let lie naked here and there.\" The rebels set fire to the White City and Kitai-gorod. They burned between 15,000 and 24,000 houses; between 1700 and 2000 people died in the riot. The rioters split into two groups to target the most hated boyars, diaks, okolnichys, and merchants, killing Nazar Chistoy as he begged for mercy.

besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely \u010citluk, Gabela, Za\u017eablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metkovi\u0107. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa."}, "history_1043": {"qa_pairs":

Nafplion , Laconia, with seat at Monemvasia , Messenia, with seat at Navarino, and Achaea, with seat at Patras . The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy. The Venetians also launched a great fortification project throughout the Morea, whose results can still be seen today.

The fleet consisted of 19 ships, 1,655 European troops and 286 Asian auxiliaries, and was led by Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen. On 21 February 1621, The fleet arrived in Fort Nassau, where it was reinforced by the fort's 250-strong garrison and 36 indigenous vessels. After unsuccessfully trying to recruit Englishmen from the nearby Run and Ay islands, Coen began sending scouts to the coastline of Lontor, the main Bandanese island. The reconnaissance took two days, during which some boats came under cannon fire from the native defenders. The scouts found fortified positions along the Southern coast and in the hills and failed to find a possible beachhead. On 7 March, a VOC probing party landed in the island but was repulsed after suffering one dead and four wounded. On 11 March he ordered a decisive assault. He divided his forces into several groups, which attacked different points in the island.

The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan - including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family - the Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia.

After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the Jets' 32-yard line, but underthrew receiver David Givens on the next play, and Andre Dyson intercepted. Pennington drove the Jets into the Titans' red zone, completing a 10-yard pass to Sean Ryan, but Ryan was hit hard by Keith Bulluck and fumbled, with Tennessee recovering. However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans' 36-yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra-point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13-0 halftime lead. Tennessee's woes in the passing game continued as soon as the second half started, with Collins getting intercepted again, this time by Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball 25 yards to the Tennessee 22. Nugent nailed an 18-yard field goal as the drive stalled at the one-yard line. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington drove to the red zone again, but Nugent missed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide right. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington appeared to find Cotchery on a 2-yard touchdown pass, but the touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stalled, Nugent missed another field goal, hitting the right upright from 30 yards out. Tennessee finally capitalized, with Travis Henry scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:48 left in the game. Tennessee went for two, and brought in Young. Young's pass intended for Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets defensive back Derrick Strait was flagged for pass interference, giving the Titans second life. They would take advantage, with Collins handing off to Henry for the conversion. After a trade of punts, the Jets took over on their own 11 with 7:28 to go. On third down, Pennington was sacked by Cortland Finnegan, and Tennessee's Randy Starks recovered at New York's 1-yard line. Tennessee went for two and converted, with Collins finding Drew Bennett open, and the game was tied, 16-16. The Jets came right back, first with Justin Miller returning the ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and then Pennington steadily driving downfield, finding Baker on the 12-yard touchdown pass to cap a 7-play, 57-yard drive. The Jets had to hold on because on the next possession, Collins found Bennett on a 26-yard completion moving the ball to midfield, and he then completed long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets' 12-yard line with 1:11 to play. The Jets locked down, and on 4th-and-6 from the Jets' 8-yard line, Collins' pass for Bo Scaife was knocked away by Rhodes, ending the game."}, "history_720": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "13ee2981-90b3-420b-b889-1b0828ead27e", "question": "How for the in were there throne Swedish 1611 many contenders?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "bbbb7611-ed3a-44a7-9560-87e24fc020ad", "question": "years the many did of last Siege How Pskov?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, "query_id": "94ff0d49-1c30-4d8f-a758-caaf05136e9e", "question": "of capture How the the De of Novgorod and many la Treaty Jacob Stolbovo signing years of Gardie's passed between?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "008e996a-5d15-4f43-8f84-4da5da110ca1", "question": "were restituted to townships Russia How many?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "0946984d-8ee4-4002-a3e2-66d0ec8bac76", "question": "laid How De Jacob years Swedish towards advanced the after expeditionary la to the a captured did repelled Gardie siege under but they many corps were and city, Novgorod Tikhvin?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "846378bb-9eb9-401d-99b2-23e26e2467ad", "question": "Russia the to the its Pskov Stolbovo Swedes Ingria of to the tried lay province access to strip Sea the Treaty awarded How years of did after Swedes siege many and the Baltic of were?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, "query_id": "f137fddb-5c9e-4c65-9667-a91cf394d28b", "question": "Tikhvin attempt on did Swedes How the siege many a years after capturing Novgorod?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "ea6db09c-e71b-43d9-8ec3-c283ce240871", "question": "capturing Novgorod after years the capture Swedes many did How Gdov?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "421e2225-c751-4fdd-8c81-e62f6a444a20", "question": "to Treaty awarded How Stolbovo many were the towhships of with Sweden?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, "query_id": "740a9363-6873-4e00-a733-741accf945e9", "question": "Treaty of passed many was before Stolbovo 1613 the the signed first attack After how years in?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}]}], "passage": "In 1611 a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod.

The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation.

uprising included large areas of Lower Bavaria, the Innviertel and eastern Bavaria. The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

November 1917 became another watershed in the 1917-1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland.

By the conclusion of the study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio. The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose Franklin D. Roosevelts paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60-70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio. Soon after Salks vaccine was licensed in 1955, childrens vaccination campaigns were launched.

Schilling was one of more than forty hostages taken by Abu Sayyaf in 2000, including twenty-one tourists and workers seized in a raid on Sipadan diving resort in neighbouring Malaysia. Many of the hostages were released after Libya paid millions of dollars. A Libyan official stated that Schilling had visited the Jolo camp often before his capture.

Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie. The Ravens would later add 16 more points on three Billy Cundiff field goals and a fumble forced by Ray Lewis and recovered by Haloti Ngata and then run into the end zone (Cundiff also missed two 51-yard field goals). This marked the first touchdown in Ngata's career. Offensively, the Ravens gained 553 yards in the entire game, a franchise record.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers.

In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term \"late modernism\" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930. Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T. S. Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound. Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem Briggflatts in 1965. In addition, Hermann Brochs The Death of Virgil was published in 1945 and Thomas Manns Doctor Faustus (novel) in 1947. Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a \"later Modernist\". Beckett is a writer with roots in the expressionist tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including Molloy (novel) (1951), Waiting for Godot (1953), Happy Days (play) (1961), and Rockaby (1981). The terms \"minimalist\" and \"post-Modernist\" have also been applied to his later works. The poets Charles Olson (1910-1970) and J. H.

From 1926 until 1935, was a member of the Sturmabteilung, the NSDAP and SS (1926-1935). During the 54th International Congress of Americanists held in Vienna in July 2012, the Colombian and US archaeologist and associate professor Augusto Oyuela-Caycedo (University of Florida) presented a conference with German anthropologist Manuela Fischer and others, where they alleged having information of Reichels youth and Oyuela has been since claiming that Reichel-Dolmatoff at age 14 in 1926 formed part of the Hitler Youth and later was SS between 1932-1935 and says he was also NSDAP member in Austria, and as a SS Sergeant in Dachau (1934-1935). Oyuela-Caycedo says he has documental support from the SS file and NSDAP file of his activities, and documents from the Federal Archive in Berlin and the National Archive in Washington D.C. In the newspaper \"The Third Front\", published by Otto Strasser who had been a leader of the NSDAP, allegeldy notes taking from an alleged \"diary\" of Reichel were published in 1936. Strasser became opposed to Hitlers branch of the Nazi party after the killing of his brother Gregor Strasser in 1934.  According to the conference paper presented by Oyuela-Caycedo and article published in December 2012 and also in further newspaper interviews and some publications Oyuela-Caycedo continues to reiterate this about Reichels past.  Oyuela-Caycedo also says Reichel by 1936 was expelled from the SS and following a mental crisis Reichel-Dolmatoff abandoned the Nationalsocialist party and SS and left Germany and Austria, and is in 1937 later living and studying in Paris. He attended classes at the Facult\u00e9 des Lettres of the Sorbonne  and in the \u00c9cole du Louvre from late 1937 to 1938. Gerardo emigrated to Colombia in 1939, where he became a Colombian citizen in 1942. Reichel became member and was the Secretary to the France Libre/Free (1942-1943) France Movement with the help of  his colleague and friend the French ethnologist Paul Rivet who was the Delegate of the Resistance of France Libre and living in Colombia. General Charles De Gaulle later awarded Reichel-Dolmatoff with the medal of the Ordre du M\u00e9rite.

On August 31, Marion rescued a small American force trapped by 500 British soldiers, under the leadership of Major C. Fraser. For this action he received the thanks of the Continental Congress. Marion commanded the right wing under General Greene at the Battle of Eutaw Springs. In January 1782, he was elected to a new State Assembly at Jacksonborough and left his troops to take up his seat. During his absence his brigade grew disheartened, particularly after a British sortie from Charleston, and there was reportedly a conspiracy to turn him over to the British. But in June of that year, he put down a Loyalist uprising on the banks of the Pee Dee River. In August he left his brigade and returned to his plantation. In 1782, the British Parliament suspended offensive operations in America, and in December 1782, the British withdrew their garrison from Charleston.

Undrafted rookie Mike Harris made his first NFL start, filing in for left tackle for an injured Jared Gaither. San Diego protected Harris by having Rivers throw short passes; sixteen of Rivers' 24 completions were to running backs and tight ends, and he threw for 231 yards while only being sacked once.

Following the birth of Princess Aiko, there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the Imperial Household Law and to make recommendations to the government. The panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession.

In November 1571, during the War between Leith and Edinburgh when Mary's supporters held Edinburgh Castle, MacGill was sent with Robert Pitcairn, Commander of Dunfermline to negotiate with Henry, Lord Hunsdon at Berwick upon Tweed. MacGill was to ask for 8 cannons, 3000 footmen and pikemen, and support for 1000 Scots troops, in the cause of the \"maintenance and protection of the true religion to the confusion of those that now goes about to disturb the same\". MacGill had a particular interest in the siege as the \"registers and records of the chief matters\" were guarded by artillery at Edinburgh Castle, together with the Scottish Crown jewels. The forces holding Edinburgh Castle, known as the Castilians, in 1572 twice destroyed MacGill's stronghouses in Edinburgh, and while the siege lasted the Burgh Council met in exile at Leith. Regent Morton wrote to MacGill in 1575 asking him to re-negotiate a gold and silver mining contract with the Dutch engineer Cornelius de Vos. A portrait painter working in Scotland at this time, Arnold Bronckorst, was associated with Cornelius and Nicholas Hilliard. Morton also obtained passports for MacGill's sons, John and David, to travel to France to continue their studies. MacGill died on 16 October 1579. Alexander Hay succeeded him as Lord Clerk Register. His executors were his wife Janet Adamsoun and son, Master James Adamson."}, "history_655": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "127", "spans": []},

Also, the Eastern Legion was formed and trained between December 1916 and May 1918 in Monarga village, near Boghazi, consisting of over 4,000 Diasporan Armenian volunteers who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Some Armenian refugees arrived from Palestine and Egypt. The Armenian-Cypriot community prospered throughout the British Era, by establishing associations. In many ways unique across the whole Armenian Diaspora, it was built just outside Nicosia between 1924-1926, after the generous and benevolent donation of the Egyptian-Armenian tobacco trading brothers Krikor and Garabed Melkonian, initially in order to shelter and educate 500 orphans of the Genocide, who planted the trees in front of the school in memory of their slaughtered relatives.

In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma.

The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920 but then states, \"Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J\u00f3zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura  and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.\" The Polish Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, as well as Western historians such as Norman Davies, consider 1919 the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier.

the Pagan Empire.

The new king would have to reestablish his power all over again by gaining the fealty of all the vassal states, usually by show of force. Of these, the remote vassal state of Toungoo , tucked away in the southeastern corner across the Pegu Yoma range, proved most troublesome to successive kings at Ava. Toungoo lords rebelled against Ava in 1426-1440, 1451-1459 and 1468-1470, usually with Pegu's implicit or explicit support. Ava also faced rebellions at Mohnyin  and Prome . The beginning of the end of Ava came in 1480. The new king Minkhaung II was greeted with a multitude of rebellions but it proved to be different this time. The most serious rebellion was by his younger brother, lord of Yamethin. With a serious rebellion so close to Ava, vassal states broke away one by one. The Yamethin rebellion went on until 1500. In 1482, Minkhaung's uncle at Prome successfully revolted, the Prome Kingdom sprang into existence. Ava's vassal Shan states of Mohnyin, Mogaung, Momeik and Kale also broke away in the 1490s. Surprisingly, Ava's steadfast ally during this period was the usually restive vassal of Toungoo which remained loyal to Ava until Minkhaung's death in 1501."}, "nfl_1478": {"qa_pairs": [{"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "7", "spans": []}, "query_id": "213f1c2f-8dbe-4e55-a89c-16959a0c378e", "question": "did the points in Joseph Addai score second many How quarter?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "6", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}, "query_id": "948f71ed-5538-4286-ba31-61ba25d49b02", "question": "touchdown longest Peyton yards many Manning's was pass How?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, "query_id": "72830a76-ba6e-4866-ad05-950c1464407b", "question": "Peyton Manning many longer 10 How touchdown throw yards did passes than?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "1", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "31", "spans": []}, "query_id": "513c00fd-9f5f-468c-8ac5-8f87b41f3fee", "question": "the did longest yards run many go How touchdown for?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "31", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}, {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "35", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}, "query_id": "a38ce93f-dd3e-46c1-9ab3-4cc9793f4fd5", "question": "national team in team Australian rugby the How Great beat 1986 did many Britain's points?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "22", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19815", "spans": []}, "query_id": "c8394254-70fd-4366-85e3-502c66458edd", "question": "How Challenege the spectators first tour and World many Kangaroo France 1989 at than Cup test for the more Britain Old Trafford Great were the of of 1986 in?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "19815", "spans": []}]}, {"answer": {"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}, "query_id": "fd71a5ac-ca49-4b44-bf0d-43542834506b", "question": "many times How the France Great tour host Trafford and did Britain Old of Kangaroo?", "validated_answers": [{"date": {"year": "", "day": "", "month": ""}, "number": "3", "spans": []}]}], "passage": " Coming off their bye week, the Colts flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 7 interconference duel with the St. Louis Rams.

It seized Bhamo from Thibaw in 1512 in the east, and raiding Kale in the west. The Ava-Thibaw alliance was able to retake Shwebo for a time but Mohnyin proved too strong. By the early 1520s, Chief Sawlon of Mohnyin had assembled a confederation of Shan states  under his leadership. Prome had also joined the confederation. The confederation wiped out Ava's defences in Shwebo in 1524. Finally on 25 March 1527, the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava.
